# Semantic Engine workflow
# ------------------------
# I configured this workflow so that every time the Streamlit app pushes
# data/user_responses.csv, the engine runs automatically on GitHub Actions.
# It processes the answers, generates the semantic scores, and commits
# the resulting CSVs + JSON back into the repository so Streamlit can
# fetch the results live.
